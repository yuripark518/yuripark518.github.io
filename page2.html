        <p>
            Re-emphasizing the reason why, recalling my own childhood misconceptions about "cute" dog breeds, 
            I was jolted to discover the hidden pain some traits cause. 
            Why not craft an engaging tool to enlighten kids about these truths, 
            ensuring a more informed and compassionate future for them and our canine friends?
            <br>
            <br>
            Building on my prior research about educating pre-schoolers, 
            as detailed in the "topic knowing" section, 
            the selected method of conveying information was designed to be child-friendly and infographic-based.
